# DigiSoc Online Events Auto Admission
Similar to [DigiSoc Events Internal](https://github.com/axieax/digisoc-events-internal) but automatically gives a user access to the event channels by assigning them the Admitted role once they fill in the registration form.

Need to enable [intents](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html) to view channel members.
